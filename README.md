## Project Description
Our goal as a group is to make an app that will change the way pizza is ordered and consumed forever. In addition to facilitating real-time inventory and menu management for pizzeria business owners, our goal is to streamline the ordering process for hungry patrons. Our app will make ordering pizza more convenient and enjoyable by providing a streamlined, straightforward interface.
