## Usage instructions
Our pizza project application is a web-based platform that allows customers to browse menus, place orders, and track their delivery in real-time. The app also includes an admin dashboard for restaurant owners to manage their inventory, prices, and menu items. With our app, customers can customize their pizzas with a variety of toppings, track the progress of their order, and receive notifications when their pizza is ready for pickup or delivery.

The app offers a range of features that make it easy and convenient for customers to order pizza, including intuitive navigation, easy payment options, and a user-friendly interface. For restaurant owners, our app provides real-time inventory management and menu updates, reducing the risk of waste and ensuring accurate pricing. We also provide a customer feedback and review system that allows restaurant owners to respond to customer concerns and feedback in real-time, helping to build stronger relationships and increase customer loyalty.

Our pizza project application is designed to meet the needs of both customers and restaurant owners, offering a reliable and convenient solution for ordering and delivering pizza. We are committed to continuously improving and updating our app to ensure that it provides the best possible experience for all users.
